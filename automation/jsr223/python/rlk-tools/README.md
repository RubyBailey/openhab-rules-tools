This folder contains the reusable rules that can be copied to another openHAB instance.
In general, configuration of a given rule is done through `$OH_CONF/automation/lib/python/configuration.py` and Group membership.
Full documentation for configuing the rule is in the comments of the rule and the README.md files in the rule's folder.
